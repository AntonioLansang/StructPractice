StructPractice

This was made so that I could share the code with one of my partners on this subject.

Lessons I learned here:

Argc and argv can actually be accounted with. Argc counts number of arguments. 
Argv[0] is the name of the program. 
When you write ./a.out, the words you write afterwords are actually arguments, like file names. 
Declare the array of structs within main. 
Then, you can send the array of structs to a function to read like this: FuncName(ArrayName); 
DO NOT put quotations in fopen UNLESS it is the name of the file
